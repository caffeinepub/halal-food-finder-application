      "featureTitle": "Reduce perceived instability in location detection and tracking by preventing conflicting location workflows and by throttling/reducing noisy updates.\n\nContext: The app supports one-time GPS detection (with GPS->IP fallback) and continuous tracking via `watchPosition`. Users report that “web site location unstable”.\n\nImplement the following behaviors:\n- If continuous tracking is active, disable or clearly gate the one-time “Detect My Location” flow so the two mechanisms do not compete.\n- Add throttling/debouncing to continuous tracking-triggered searches so location-based searches are not triggered too frequently even when coordinates jitter; keep the existing “significant change” check but also enforce a minimum time interval between searches.\n- Reduce user-facing noise: avoid firing a success toast on every tracking update; only toast on tracking start/stop and on meaningful state changes (e.g., first fix acquired, permission denied, tracking error).\n- Ensure tracking can recover cleanly from transient errors: if `watchPosition` emits a TIMEOUT/POSITION_UNAVAILABLE error, reflect it in UI state without leaving the app stuck in an in-flight state, and allow the user to stop/restart tracking.",

If the counter fails, show a non-blocking fallback such as “Total visits: unavailable” (English text).\n- Add a lightweight retry strategy on the frontend for the counter fetch/increment (e.g., one retry after a short delay) so transient actor/network failures in production don’t permanently hide the counter for the session.\n- Keep the rest of the app functional even if the counter fails (no hard errors).",
